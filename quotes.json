तेन त्यक्तेन भुञ्जीथा मा गृध: कस्यस्विद् धनम् ॥",
    "meaning": "This 'shloka' is from Ishavasya upanishad. Here I am giving two explanations of this shloka. One is from the book:- Sanskrit Subhashit Navnet, published by Jamnabai Narsee Adhyatmik trust. Another is from one article. This is a not a suBAshit as such but as it has good teaching in it we are sending it to the group. In this moving world, whatever moves is enveloped (is prevaded) by God. Therefore, you find your enjoyment (or protect yourself) by offering it to him (i.e. by renunciation) [To whom does the wealth belong? It belongs to no one] Be no greedy to what belongs to others. Whatever animate or inanimate objects we witness in this world are the abode of the Almighty. Enjoy it with a sense of renunciation, do not grab, because it belongs to nobody i.e. the resources of the world belong to God and it is for his pleasure that they ought to be used.",

    "quote": "यस्मिन् जीवति जीवन्ति बहव: स तु जीवति ।
काकोऽपि किम् न कुरुते चञ्च्वा स्वोदरपूरणम् ॥",
    "meaning": "If the 'living' of a person results in 'living' of many other persons, only then consider that person to have really 'lived'. Look even the crow fill it's own stomach by it's beak!! (There is nothing great in working for our own survival) I am not finding any proper adjective to describe how good this subhashita is! The subhashitkar has hit at very basic question. What are all the humans doing ultimately? Working to feed themselves (and their family). So even a bird like crow does this! In fact there need not be any more explanation to tell what this subhashita implies! Just the subhashita is sufficient!!",
